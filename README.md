# iiTools
This project is to create tools that I can use to process my trades, dividends and positions etc 
to help me monitor my trading ISA better.

Started with a some dividend aggregations.

Plan: 
Load into a DB.
Setup initial positions.
load in trades. 
Calc PnL on a trade level and position level.
See dividend aggregations at position level.


That's the plan at least...
